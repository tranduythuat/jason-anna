        <h2>Is there anything planned for Saturday night 15th Novor are we free to roam around?</h2>
        <p>No, there is no specific plan on that night. We recommend guests to visit the Pho DI Bo Ninh Binh Walking Street in town. A beautiful temple is lit up at night on a small island in the lake and there are alot of Viet-namese food vendors there as well. You may want to go to bed early as the bus will pick you up 7am the next day to Halong Bay!</p>
        <p>Will I have a private room and bathroom on the cruise? Yes, you will share with your family or partner.</p>
